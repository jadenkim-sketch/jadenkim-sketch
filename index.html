  1. Sequoia National Park - This is one of my favorite National Parks due to the mountianous landscape and its rich and lush vegitation.
  Filled with Giant Sequoia trees the so tall that you can't even see the top and trunks as big as your car. I enjoy the wildlife there and
  The many places to see there. I always walking through and despite the many people that go there, I feel at piece with these ginormous trees
  all around me.

    2. King's Canyon National Park - Kings Canyon has always been one of my all favorite National Parks not just because of the canyons and the
    forest but because of the wild river rapids and waterfalls.
