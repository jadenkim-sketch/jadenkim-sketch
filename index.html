    Hello, This is jadenkim-sketch and this is my website on my top 3 favorite national parks! (Not ranked)
  </h2>

  1. Sequoia National Park - This is one of my favorite National Parks due to the mountianous landscape and its rich and lush vegitation.
  Filled with Giant Sequoia trees the so tall that you can't even see the top and trunks as big as your car. I enjoy the wildlife there and
  The many places to see there. I always walking through and despite the many people that go there, I feel at piece with these ginormous trees
  all around me.

    2. King's Canyon National Park - Kings Canyon has always been one of my all favorite National Parks not just because of the canyons and the
    forest but because of the wild river rapids and waterfalls. I camped there once and it was one of the best camping trips I could remember.
    Even though I have been wanting to go again there have been seasons where it was impossible to go and because it's so popular, it is always
    packed. Also, it is right next to Sequoia National Park so if you want to go to both it is possible.

    3. Yellowstone National Park - Yellowstone national park is a national park I have never been to. Althought I have never been there and it is
    one of the most well known national parks, I still have an ongoing goal of going there at least one. To see the volcanic activity and geysers
    such as Old Faithful I have only seen in videos and photos. I want to be able to encounter bison on the road just to look and observe and take
    in the wildlife that is in store there. Even if I haven't been there it is a national park is worth for all people to go to.
